#3D Text Website
Back in 2013 I've created this tiny website as a experiment with CSS. I wanted to create fancy 3D text only with some lines of code. You can even share your texts via the share button (example: [Hello World!](http://3d.alexkaessner.de/?text=Hello%20World!)). That's itâ€¦

Now I thought it's time to share the code. You can do what you want fork, download or just copy. My code is **MIT licensed**.

##Copyright
For some animations I used:
 - [script.aculo.us](https://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous), version 1.9.0
 - [Prototype JavaScript framework](https://github.com/sstephenson/prototype), version 1.7

*Both JavaScript Frameworks are already included in the repo.*
